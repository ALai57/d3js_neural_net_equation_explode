			<h3>UNDERSTANDING NEURAL NETWORK MATHEMATICS</h3>

			<p>Artificial Neural Networks take a few key behaviors from brain cells and try to replicate those behaviors in a computer program. Specifically, there are three features that are explicitly programmed into an artificial neural network.</p>
			
			<p><strong>1) Cell Input/Output Relationships.</strong> 
			Real brain cells receive electrical input signals and send out electrical signals to other cells. In a real brain cell, the cell's electrical output is directly related to the cell's electrical input. The neural network is set up the same way: nodes in the artificial neural network listen to inputs, then respond with outputs.<p>
			
			<p><strong>2) Threshold.</strong> 
			In the brain, cells must exceed a minimum threshold of electrical input to start generating outputs. Essentially, there's a threshold effect - below the threshold, nothing happens. Above the threshold value, more input leads to more output. The artificial neural network will replicate this feature of real cells: the node will only have output if the input exceeds a threshold value.</p>
			
			<p><strong>3) Selective listening.</strong>
			In the brian, not all electrical input signals are equal; input signals from some brain cells count more than others. For example, some signals could be worth 3x more than others. And some signals could be worth nothing at all. In the artificial neural network, we will replicate this principle by weighting each node's inputs differently.</p>
