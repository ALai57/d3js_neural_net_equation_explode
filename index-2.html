	  <h3>UNDERSTANDING NEURAL NETWORK MATHEMATICS</h3>

	  <p>Artificial Neural Networks are computer programs that emulate the way actual Neurons behave. Three key features of biological cells are explicitly programmed into an artificial neural network.</p>

	  <p><strong>1) Flow of information.</strong>
	    In real neural networks, information flows into a Neuron, then the Neuron decides what to do, and it sends signals to the next Neurons down the chain. The neural network is set up the same way: nodes in the artificial neural network listen to inputs, then respond with outputs.<p>

	  <p><strong>2) Threshold.</strong>
	    In a real brain cell, there is a minimum amount of electrical input required to start generating outputs. If the amount of input is below the threshold, nothing happens. Once the amount of input exceeds the threshold value, more input leads to more output. Artificial neural networks replicate this feature of real cells: the node will only have output if the input exceeds a threshold value.</p>

	  <!-- <p>The figure below shows data from real neurons - it shows that once neurons get enough signals coming in, they start sending signals of their own.</p> -->

	  <p><strong>3) Selective listening.</strong>
	    In the brian, not all electrical input signals are equivalent; input signals from some brain cells counts more than others. For example, signals from Neuron A could be worth 3x more than signals from Neuron B. And some signals could be worth nothing at all. Artificial neural networks, replicate this principle by weighting inputs.</p>
